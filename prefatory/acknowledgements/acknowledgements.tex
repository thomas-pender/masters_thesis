 I would like to thank Dr. H. Kharaghani for his remarkable teaching prowess and his singular patience. There can be no doubt that if I have found any success during my studies, it is precisely because of my teacher, Hadi. 
 
 Furthermore, thanks are owed to Dr. S. Suda who, with an abundance of charity, agreed to include me in his collaboration with Dr. H. Kharaghani.
 
 Finally, I would like to recognize the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Lethbridge. Truly, here is a group of talented individuals with a passion for teaching and sharing their expertise.
