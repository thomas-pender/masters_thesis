 I would like to thank Dr. H. Kharaghani for his remarkable teaching prowess and his singular patience. There can be no doubt that if I have found any success during my studies, it is precisely because of my teacher, Hadi. 
 
 Furthermore, thanks are owed to Dr. S. Suda who, with an abundance of charity, agreed to include me in his collaboration with Dr. H. Kharaghani.

 The author's correspondence with the aforemention researchers has proven to be
 most valuable. Indeed, their patience in allowing me to ``catch-up'' in order
 to provide my own insights and contributions in equal measure has been indispensable.
 
 Finally, I would like to recognize the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Lethbridge. Truly, here is a group of talented individuals with a passion for teaching and sharing their expertise.
