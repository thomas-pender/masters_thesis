In this final chapter of results, we present a general method
\cite[see][]{w-mat-construct} to construct certain configurations using
classical parameter BGW matrices and the generalized simplex codes. This method
is similar to that given by \cite{rajkundlia} and \cite{ionin-bgw-bibd}, but it
can be seen that it is much simpler to apply than the recursive methods of the
aforementioned seminal articles. Following the presentation of this construction
technique, we find an equivalence between arbitrary BGW matrices over a finite
abelian group and certain commutative association schemes. This result
generalizes those obtained over the course of the previous chapter. The results
presented here are a modified version of \cite{w-mat-construct}.

 \section{\centering A General Method}
 
 In this section, the general method intimated above is derived and used in the
 construction of weighing matrices and symmetric designs. Resulting parameters
 of configurations so constructible are then tabulated.

 \section{\centering BGW Matrices and Association Schemes}
 
 In this section we present perhaps the most striking result of this thesis. Here
 the equivalence between BGW matrices and commutative association schemes is
 described in detail.
