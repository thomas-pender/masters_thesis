This chapter serves as a particular application of a more general construction
to be given in the following chapter. Here a new family of balanced weighing
matrices are constructed, and an equivalence to certain association schemes is
developed. The work shown here is a modified version of \cite{new-bw}. 

 \section{\centering Generalized Kronecker Product}
 
 In this section, we briefly review the Kronecker product and a few of its properties and applications, namely, we will see its applications to regular Hadamard matrices. Following this, we will consider a simple generalization of the Kronecker product in order to allow particular bijections to act on a matrix.

 \section{\centering A New Family of Balanced Weighing Matrices}
 
 Here the generalized Kronecker product of the previous subsection will be put to use in constructing a new family of balanced weighing matrices. Additionally, the simplex codes appear again and are applied in the construction. The construction presented here is indicative of a general method to be presented in the following chapter.

 \section{\centering Weighing Matrices and Association Schemes}
 
 In \cite{distance-regular-graphs} it is shown that symmetric designs are equivalent to certain 3-class association schemes. It is a natural question to ask whether or not a balanced weighing matrix could be related to this scheme, particularly an augmentation. This is the goal of this subsection.
